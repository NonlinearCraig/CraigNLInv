# README

- Template 1 runs with SyGuS via python base API. Please refer to the instructions below to run the benchmarks.

â€‹         https://cvc5.github.io/docs/cvc5-1.1.2/api/python/base/python.html

- Template 2 runs with command line mode, for the python base API doesn't support the template we specify. 

  One can run the benchmarks with (take ex1 as an example) :

  > cvc5 --verbose ex1.smt2
